FrameShoot 1.0.0

A very simple program to create traditional photo animations with your webcam.
The program consists of a webcam screen and a simple interface to take snapshots and save them to a folder in JPG format. You can create frame-by-frame photographic stop-motion animations by taking sequential shots of objects or drawings. The program has an onion skin feature to give you a reference of the previous frame and help you arrange the new frame or create the next drawing. All the shots will be saved to a folder named "frames". You can load all the frames into a video editing program to generate a video or into an photo editing program to create an animated GIF.

Instructions:
- unzip the ZIP archive to a folder
- place your webcam in front or over the scene or drawing you want to animate
- click on "Shoot frame" to take the first frame
- the frame will automatically be overlayed in transparency as onion skin.
- click on "Onion Skin" to toggle onion skin on and off
- find all the images in the "frames" folder
- import the frames in a video or photo editing program to create a video or a GIF
