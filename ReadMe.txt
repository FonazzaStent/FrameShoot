FrameShoot 2.1.1

A very simple program to create traditional photo animations with your webcam.
The program consists of a webcam screen and a simple interface to take snapshots and save them to a folder in JPG format. You can create frame-by-frame photographic stop-motion animations by taking sequential shots of objects or drawings. The program has an onion skin feature to give you a reference of the previous frame and help you arrange the new frame or create the next drawing. All the shots will be saved to a folder named "frames". You can use the internal AVI and GIF generation functions or  load all the frames into a video editing program to generate a video or into an photo editing program to create an animated GIF.

Instructions:
- unzip the ZIP archive to a folder
- place your webcam in front or over the scene or drawing you want to animate
- click on "Shoot frame" to take the first frame
- the frame will automatically be overlayed in transparency as onion skin
- click on "Toggle onion skin" to toggle onion skin on and off
- click on "First/last frame" to overlay as onion skin first or last frame (useful for looped GIFs)
- Click on "Flip" to flip the frame horizontally and vertically
- File-Preview (Alt-P) to preview the animation with your default video player
- File-Export to AVI (Alt-A) to export the animation to an AVI format video
- File-Export to GIF (Alt-G) to export the animation to an animated GIF
- Set the framerate typing a value in the "Frames per second" field + Enter or click on "Set"

- The program will remember last onion skin frame when you open it
- if you want to work on more than one project at a time, you can rename the "frames" folder to your project name and start a new project. To work on a project you put on hold through this procedure, rename the folder back to "frames". You can also store the project in another folder and copy it back to the main program folder when you want to work on it. Just remember to rename the project folder "frames".
